# igm_emulator_example
This repo includes some example codes I wrote for the private repo enigma-igm.

The technical part of this project is about:
  - building a Neural Network Emulator with JAX/Haiku
  - application with HMC (Hamiltonian Monte Carlo inference) in No U-Turn Sampler (NUTS) from NumPyro.

The physics goal is to:
  - accurately infer thermal states of the high-redshift intergalactic medium from Lyman-alpha auto-correlation functions
